# Black Hole Simulation

![Banner](assets/gif/banner.gif)

A real-time, GPU-accelerated browser visualization of a black hole with an accretion flow, jet models, and relativistic optical effects. Runs entirely in the browser using WebGL and [three.js](https://threejs.org).

**[Live Demo](https://adriwin06.github.io/black-hole)** — Chrome or Firefox on a dedicated GPU recommended.

> This is a substantially extended fork of [oseiskar/black-hole](https://github.com/oseiskar/black-hole). See [What's new](#whats-new-in-this-fork) for a summary of additions.

> Scientific scope: Schwarzschild photon geodesics follow the exact Binet equation, but rendered fidelity still depends on the integrator, step budget, and adaptive stepping. Spin, accretion, jet, and GRMHD-related options use a mix of analytic, semi-analytic, and heuristic approximations; returning radiation is not ray-traced, and jet colours use an effective-temperature proxy rather than a frequency-resolved synchrotron spectrum. See [docs/physics.html](docs/physics.html) for what is exact and what is approximate.

## Features

### Physics & Rendering
- **Two public spin modes** — `Fast (Binet lensing)` traces photons with the Schwarzschild Binet solver (exact for a = 0) plus perturbative spin heuristics; `Kerr-inspired disk velocities` keeps the same approximate photon solver but uses Kerr equatorial angular velocity to drive disk matter
- **Three accretion disk models** — thin disk (Shakura–Sunyaev), thick torus (ADAF/RIAF), and slim disk (super-Eddington)
- **GRMHD-inspired accretion controls** — plasma beta (β), magnetic-field strength, `R_high` electron-heating / Ti:Te proxy controls, MAD/SANE magnetic flux, MRI-inspired turbulence, and kappa-distribution electron parameters
- **Relativistic effects** — gravitational redshift, Doppler shift, thermal/background beaming controls (physical D³ Liouville or cinematic), aberration, time dilation
- **Relativistic jets** — simple analytic jet or a more detailed GRMHD-inspired jet model with spine/sheath structure, reconfinement shocks, jet-corona connection, and Blandford–Znajek-inspired power scaling
- **Black-body spectrum** — temperature-dependent disk coloring with precomputed Planck lookup
- **Multiple tone-mapping modes** — ACES Filmic, AgX, and Scientific (logarithmic inferno colormap)
- **Multi-pass bloom** — threshold → mip-chain Gaussian blur → weighted composite

### Post-Processing & Quality
- **Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)** — history accumulation with motion rejection and clip-box clamping for cleaner still frames
- **Six quality presets** — Mobile, Optimal, Medium, High, Ultra, and Cinematic
- **Auto GPU benchmark** — measures frame time on first load and keeps Optimal on capable systems or falls back to Mobile

### User Interface
- **dat.GUI control panel** — resizable right-side panel with collapsible folders for every parameter
- **Astrophysical presets** — literature-inspired starting points for M87\*, Sgr A\*, Cygnus X-1, GRS 1915+105, and more
- **Observer controls** — mouse orbit/pan/roll, a bottom-left observer widget with distance dial + motion toggle, and optional automatic circular orbit in the stable Schwarzschild regime (`r >= 3 r_s`)

### Presentation & Recording
- **Presentation Timeline** — bottom-docked dopesheet editor (inspired by Blender / After Effects) for scripted keyframe animations, preset loading, playback, and recording; supports linear, smooth, and smoother easing
- **Built-in interactive scenarios** — *Freefall Dive* and *Hover Approach*
- **Live scenario capture to timeline** — record a manual *Freefall Dive* or *Hover Approach* run, including orbit/pan camera motion and captured shader time, straight into timeline tracks, with optional camera smoothing
- **Built-in timeline presets** — *Full Feature Tour* (186 s) and *Orbit Showcase*
- **WebM video recording** — realtime MediaRecorder capture plus offline WebCodecs/WebM muxing when supported
- **Offline PNG snapshot** — one-click still export that forces the Cinematic (offline) quality preset before download
- **High-quality offline rendering** — Cinematic preset with manually boosted supersampling for publication-quality stills and video frames

## Physics Documentation

See **[docs/physics.html](docs/physics.html)** for a detailed description of the models, equations, approximations, and implementation scope used in the simulation, with academic references and notes on where the renderer departs from full GRRT/GRMHD treatments.

## Quick Start

Clone or download this repository, then launch a local HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in a modern browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended). A dedicated GPU is recommended for smooth rendering.

### Performance tips

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Lower quality preset (GUI → Quality) | Reduces integration steps and supersampling |
| Shrink the browser window | Fewer pixels to trace |
| Disable the planet | Removes ray-sphere intersection tests |
| Disable RK4 | Falls back to leapfrog / Störmer-Verlet integration (faster, less accurate near the photon sphere) |
| Switch solver mode to Fast | Uses the lightweight Binet photon solver everywhere |

## Controls

- **Left drag** — orbit the camera
- **Right drag** — pan
- **Left + Right drag** — roll
- **Scroll** — zoom in/out
- **Controls panel** (right side, `CONTROLS ▶`) — all simulation parameters
- **Animations panel** (left side, `◀ ANIMATIONS`) — Freefall Dive, Hover Approach, and live capture of those runs into the timeline
- **Observer widget** (bottom-left XYZ indicator) — distance dial, motion toggle, camera reset
- **Timeline panel** (bottom, `▲ TIMELINE`) — preset loading, timeline editing, playback, recording, and export/import

### Key GUI parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **a/M** | Signed black hole spin; positive and negative values mirror the spin direction |
| **solver mode** | `Fast (Binet lensing)` or `Kerr-inspired disk velocities`; the latter keeps approximate photon lensing but uses Kerr angular velocity to drive disk matter |
| **temperature (K)** | Visualized disk color temperature in Kelvin (4,500 – 30,000 K) |
| **disk model** | Thin disk, thick torus (ADAF), or slim disk |
| **doppler shift (color)** | Toggle relativistic red/blue spectral shifting for black-body-based thermal emitters and the background-sky proxy; jets keep their own synchrotron-motivated transfer |
| **physical (D³ Liouville)** | Use physically motivated beaming for thermal emitters and the background-sky proxy instead of the softened cinematic curve |
| **jet enabled / mode** | Toggle jets and choose simple or more detailed GRMHD-inspired shading |
| **observer motion** | Toggle automatic circular orbit around the black hole; motion is clamped to the stable Schwarzschild regime (`r >= 3 r_s`) |
| **quality preset** | Mobile / Optimal / Medium / High / Ultra / Cinematic |

### Quality preset levels

| Preset | Steps (fast / Kerr-inspired) | Supersampling | Description |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Mobile | 28 / 120 | 1× | 0.55× resolution + TAA; fastest |
| Optimal | 100 / 400 | 1× | 0.8× res + TAA; recommended default |
| Medium | 100 / 400 | 1× / 3× | Full resolution; balanced |
| High | 320 / 520 | 4× | Full resolution; GPU-intensive |
| Ultra | 600 / 1400 | 4× / 6× | Maximum fidelity |
| Cinematic | 600 / 1400 | 6x / 12x | Offline rendering quality |

### Built-in black hole presets

| Preset | Object | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Default | Generic BH | a/M = 0.90, thin disk |
| M87\* | Virgo A SMBH | Illustrative high-spin, MAD-like thick-torus + jet configuration inspired by EHT-era GRMHD studies |
| Sgr A\* | Milky Way centre | Illustrative moderate-spin ADAF/RIAF-style torus; EHT modeling does not determine a unique spin |
| Cygnus X-1 | X-ray binary | Near-extremal thin-disk preset inspired by continuum-fitting studies |
| GRS 1915+105 | Microquasar | Near-extremal slim-disk preset inspired by continuum-fitting and jet observations |
| Gargantua (Interstellar visuals) | Film-inspired | Warm thin disk, boosted glow, softened relativistic effects |
| Schwarzschild | Textbook case | Spin disabled, clean circular shadow |

## How It Works

1. Each screen pixel casts a ray from the camera into the scene.
2. The ray direction is transformed for **relativistic aberration** if the observer is moving.
3. Photon paths are traced with the **Schwarzschild Binet equation** (leapfrog / RK4). The optional `Kerr-inspired disk velocities` mode keeps the same photon solver but upgrades disk matter to a Kerr-inspired orbital-velocity model.
4. At each step, intersections with the accretion disk, GRMHD-inspired media, jets, and planet are tested and composited using Beer–Lambert transmittance.
5. **Doppler shift, gravitational redshift, and beaming** are applied with model-appropriate transfer rules; jets use a separate synchrotron-motivated treatment.
6. The background sky (Milky Way panorama + star field) is rendered with optional Doppler color shifting.
7. The HDR accumulation buffer is bloom-composited and then tone-mapped to sRGB.
8. Optionally, TAA accumulates multiple jittered frames before display.
